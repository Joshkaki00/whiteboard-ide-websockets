   - OR click the direct link shared with you

2. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem in the left sidebar
   - Note the difficulty, examples, and constraints
   - Ask questions in the chat if unclear

3. **Start Coding**
   - Type your solution in the code editor
   - Choose your preferred language (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++)
   - Your code syncs automatically with the interviewer

4. **Use the Whiteboard**
   - Visualize your approach before coding
   - Draw out data structures or algorithm flows
   - Explain your thinking as you draw

5. **Communicate**
   - Use the chat for quick questions

## Tips for Great Interviews

### For Interviewers
- ‚úÖ Start with a random Easy problem to warm up
- ‚úÖ Lock the view mode to "Whiteboard" for system design discussions
- ‚úÖ Use the chat for subtle hints without verbal interruption
- ‚úÖ Resize panels to focus on what matters (code vs whiteboard)
- ‚úÖ Watch the timer to keep the interview on track

### For Candidates
- ‚úÖ Use the whiteboard BEFORE coding to plan your approach
- ‚úÖ Talk through your thought process as you type
- ‚úÖ Test your code mentally with the given examples
- ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions about edge cases
- ‚úÖ Don't forget to consider time and space complexity
