## Backend Deployment (Choose One Platform)

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended)
- [ ] Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Create new project from GitHub repo
- [ ] Add environment variables:
  ```
  CORS_ORIGIN=https://joshkaki00.github.io
  PORT=3001
  ```
- [ ] Set start command: `tsx server/index.ts`
- [ ] Deploy and wait for completion
- [ ] Copy Railway URL
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

### Option 2: Render
- [ ] Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Create new Web Service
- [ ] Connect GitHub repo
- [ ] Configure:
  - Build: `npm install`
  - Start: `tsx server/index.ts`
- [ ] Add environment variables (same as Railway)
- [ ] Deploy and copy URL
- [ ] Test health endpoint

### Option 3: Other (Vercel, Heroku, Self-hosted)
- [ ] Follow steps in BACKEND_DEPLOY.md
- [ ] Copy backend URL
- [ ] Test health endpoint

**Backend URL**: `_____________________________`

---

## Connect Frontend to Backend

### Update Environment Variables
- [ ] Create file: `.env.production` (if doesn't exist)
- [ ] Add your backend URL:
  ```
  VITE_SERVER_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
  ```
- [ ] Commit changes:
  ```bash
  git add .env.production
  git commit -m "Add production backend URL"
  git push origin main
  ```
- [ ] Wait for GitHub Actions to redeploy (~2 min)

---

## Testing & Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Frontend loads: `https://joshkaki00.github.io/whiteboard-ide-websockets/`
- [ ] Backend responds: `https://your-backend-url.com/health`
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] Socket.IO connects (check browser console)

### Functionality Tests

#### Room Creation
- [ ] Click "Start New Session"
- [ ] Room code appears (8 characters)
- [ ] Chat panel shows "User joined"
- [ ] Connection status shows "Connected"

#### Room Joining
- [ ] Open new browser window/incognito
- [ ] Click "Join Session"
- [ ] Enter room code from first window
- [ ] Successfully joins room
- [ ] Both windows show 2 participants

#### Real-Time Sync
- [ ] Chat messages appear in both windows instantly
- [ ] Code edits sync in real-time
- [ ] Language changes update both users
- [ ] Timer syncs across users
- [ ] Problem switching works for both

#### UI/UX
- [ ] XP and level badges display
- [ ] Achievement badges show
- [ ] Problem tabs work (Description/Examples/Constraints)
- [ ] Timer controls function (Start/Pause/Reset)
- [ ] Whiteboard drawing works
- [ ] Mobile blocker shows on phone (<768px)
- [ ] Tablet layout works (768-1023px)
- [ ] Desktop layout works (1024px+)

## Post-Deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with live demo link
- [ ] Verify all documentation links work
- [ ] Add backend URL to DEPLOYMENT.md

### Sharing
- [ ] Share link with friends/colleagues
- [ ] Test with real users
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Note any issues

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Check backend logs regularly
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions for failed deployments
- [ ] Track user feedback

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solutions**:
- [ ] Verify backend is running (check health endpoint)
- [ ] Confirm CORS_ORIGIN matches exactly (no trailing slash)
- [ ] Check `.env.production` has correct backend URL
- [ ] Verify frontend redeployed after env update

### Issue: CORS errors in console
**Solutions**:
- [ ] Check backend CORS_ORIGIN environment variable
- [ ] Ensure it matches: `https://joshkaki00.github.io` (exact match)
- [ ] Restart backend after changing env vars
- [ ] Clear browser cache

### Issue: Page loads but stuck on "Connecting..."
**Solutions**:
- [ ] Check if backend supports WebSockets
- [ ] Verify Socket.IO port is correct
- [ ] Test backend health endpoint
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Features work locally but not in production
**Solutions**:
- [ ] Verify environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Check for console errors
- [ ] Ensure both frontend and backend deployed latest code
- [ ] Test with browser cache disabled
